# Setup

First, download the repo. 

Second, create a the config.py file `lolassethelper/config.py`. Copy the `config.example.py` file, remove the example from the file name and insert all the requested values

After that, you can already run the script (currently it only supports challenges):
```bash
python3 -m lolassethelper.challenges
```
The generated files should be in a `output/` directory.
